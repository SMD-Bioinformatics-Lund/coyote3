# Best Practices for Productive Use

## Daily workflow discipline

1. start from `/samples/live`
2. confirm sample metadata first
3. set gene filters before deep interpretation
4. review and classify consistently
5. preview report before final save

## Commenting standards

Use structured comments:

- what changed
- why it changed
- what evidence drove decision

## Filter management

- avoid ad-hoc filter churn without documenting rationale
- prefer curated ISGL where possible
- use ad-hoc genes as explicit case-level exceptions

## Collaboration

- hand off with concise comments and clear status
- avoid ambiguous terms in free-text notes
- align on tier/classification criteria within team
