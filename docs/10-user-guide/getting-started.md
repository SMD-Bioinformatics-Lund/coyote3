# Getting Started

1. **Sign in**
   - If LDAP is configured, sign in with your organizational account.
   - Otherwise, an admin creates your user and sets a password.
2. **Your role and permissions**
   - Your UI adapts based on your **role** and **permissions** (RBAC). Some buttons/links may be hidden.
3. **Navigate**
   - Use the top navigation and dynamic assay groups to reach DNA, RNA, Samples, or Admin sections.
4. **Open a sample**
   - From Samples, select a case. Access is enforced based on the sample's `assay` using decorators.
