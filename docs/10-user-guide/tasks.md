# Common Tasks (End Users)

## View DNA variants for a sample
1. Go to **Samples** → open a sample.
2. If the sample assay is DNA, you're routed to the DNA variant view (`dna_bp.list_variants`).
3. Use filters and gene lists (ISGL) to focus the results.

## View RNA fusions for a sample
1. Open a sample with RNA assay.
2. You’ll be taken to **RNA → Fusions** with dynamic filters (`rna_bp`).

## Export / Print
- Use **Print** actions on detail pages to generate print‑friendly layouts (see `admin/templates/*/print_*.html`).

## Troubleshooting
- “Access denied” usually means your **role** or **assays** do not match the sample. Contact an admin.
