This module initializes the DNA blueprint for the Coyote3 project.

- Registers the `dna_bp` Flask blueprint for genomic data analysis routes.
- Imports view and filter modules for DNA-related endpoints.
- Configures a dedicated logger for DNA operations.

Blueprint:
    dna_bp: Flask blueprint for DNA-related routes.

Logger:
    app.dna_logger: Logger instance for DNA operations.
