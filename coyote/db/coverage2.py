    A handler class for managing d4 coverage data in the database.

    This class provides methods to interact with the `coverage2` collection in MongoDB,
    allowing for efficient retrieval and deletion of coverage data associated with specific samples.

    It acts as an interface between the application and the database, ensuring proper
    handling of d4 coverage data for downstream analysis and reporting.
