description: |
  Welcome to the landing page for somatic sequencing-based assays offered by the Section for Molecular Diagnostics (SMD). For constitutional analysis, please visit https://genpaneler.genetiklund.se/. SMD provides sequencing-based assays to support all medical specialties within Region Skåne. For cancer diagnostics, our primary collaborators are the Clinical Genetics and Pathology sections at Region Skåne.<br>
  The purpose of this website is to provide an overview of the sequencing assays available at SMD for the analysis of somatic alterations in cancer. The assays offered include whole genome sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing, and a variety of targeted gene panels. By exploring the assay catalog, you will find detailed information on the available assays, associated gene lists (where applicable), and the genetic alterations and biomarkers covered by each assay
