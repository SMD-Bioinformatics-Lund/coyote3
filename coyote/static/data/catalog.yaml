      This track includes datasets related to hematology, focusing on blood-related studies and analyses.
      In case of question hereditary myeloid neoplasia in patients previously analysed with parade myeloid gene panel,
      data from the normal sample can be used for constitutional analysis of the following genes. Technically, the
      sequencing is carried out on a so-called KAPA-Twist hybrid capture panel and the constitutional analysis mainly
      include smaller sequence variants (SNV/indels) in coding regions while larger copy balance abnormalities are not
      detected. In cases where the patient has not been analyzed with parade myeloid gene panel, the WGS list Hereditary
      haematological malignancy is instead referred.

      This track encompasses datasets related to solid tumors, including various types of cancers affecting solid organs.
      In case of question hereditary cancer syndrome in patients previously analysed with parade cancer gene panel,
      data from the normal sample can be used for constitutional analysis of the following genes. Technically, the

      include smaller sequence variants (SNV/indels) in coding regions while larger copy balance abnormalities are not
